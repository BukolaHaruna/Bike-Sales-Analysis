  Customers with higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes. Males have a higher average income than females, and buyers tend to earn more than non-buyers.
- Purchase by Age Brackets
  Middle-aged customers have the highest bike purchase rates, while younger and older customers buy fewer bikes. However, non-buyers follow a similar trend across all age groups.
